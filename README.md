# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis

DESCRIPTION Objective: Use data to understand what factors affect the number of bike trips. Make a predictive model to predict the number of trips in a particular hour slot, depending on the environmental conditions.

Problem Statement: Lyft, Inc. is a transportation network company based in San Francisco, California and operating in 640 cities in the United States and 9 cities in Canada. It develops, markets, and operates the Lyft mobile app, offering car rides, scooters, and a bicycle-sharing system. It is the second largest rideshare company in the world, second to only Uber.

Lyftâ€™s bike-sharing service is also among the largest in the USA. Being able to anticipate demand is extremely important for planning of bicycles, stations, and the personnel required to maintain these. This demand is sensitive to a lot of factors like season, humidity, rain, weekdays, holidays, and more. To enable this planning, Lyft needs to rightly predict the demand according to these factors.
